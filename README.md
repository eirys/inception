My 42 project Inception
Learn how to use docker, understand containers, and deploy a full LEMP website.

For security purposes, some files were replaced with a `_sample` variant.
Follow the instructions specified in those files if you want to `make` this project.

Special thanks to @jodufour, @motoure and @mderome. Their help was invaluable in the making of this project.
